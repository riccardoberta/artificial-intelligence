# Lecture Notes on Artficial Intelligence

Here you can find the lecture notes for the a course on Artificial Intelligence by [Prof. Riccardo Berta](https://about.me/riccardo.berta). The lecture notes are provided as several notebooks, each one covering a specific topic. 

Unfortunately, GitHub's notebook viewer does not render some features, such as interactive plots, it's slower, the math equations are not always displayed correctly, and large notebooks often fail to open. So if you want to play with the code, you need to run the notebooks. You can do that in three ways:

1. **Locally**: you can clone this GitHub repository and start Jupyter Notebook. This is the best option if you want to explore the notebooks in read-write mode, modify them and run the code. However, you need to have Python and all libraries installed on your computer, and you need to install all the dependencies required by the notebooks, which can be time-consuming and somehow challenging. Here you can find a guide on **[how to install Python and all libraries on your computer](./Installation-instructions.md)**.

2. **Online**: you can click on the button <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/riccardoberta/artificial-intelligence"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jupyter/design/master/logos/Badges/nbviewer_badge.svg" alt="Render nbviewer" /></a>. This will open the notebook on nbviewer, a free online service that renders notebooks as static web pages. This is similar to GitHub's notebook viewer, except that it properly renders more features (including interactive plots), it's faster, and it also allows you to download the notebook. However, you will not be able to modify the notebooks or run any code (except for the interactive plots).

The notebooks of this course are based on contents and examples from the book by Russel and Norving  ["Artificial Intelligence: a modern approachâ€œ](https://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/)
